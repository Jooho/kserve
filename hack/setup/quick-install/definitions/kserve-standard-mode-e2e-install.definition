# KServe Standard Mode E2E Test Install Definition
#
# This definition file specifies components for E2E testing of KServe in Standard mode.
# Uses Kustomize-based KServe installation for E2E testing.
#
# Note: This uses kserve-kustomize which deploys KServe from the kustomize configurations
#       in the current repository (config/crd, config/default). This means it deploys
#       from the source code in your PR, not from a released version.
#
# Components are installed in the order listed.
# Uninstallation happens in reverse order.
