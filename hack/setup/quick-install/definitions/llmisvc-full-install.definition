# LLM InferenceService Full Install Definition
#
# Note: This is a standalone installation script (RELEASE: true) that embeds all Kubernetes
#       manifests. It generates manifests from the kustomize configurations in the current
#       repository (config/crd/llmisvc, config/overlays/llmisvc), then embeds them into a
#       single script. This single file can install everything from dependencies to KServe
#       without requiring the repository or internet access (except for Helm chart downloads).
# Components are installed in the order listed.
# Uninstallation happens in reverse order.
